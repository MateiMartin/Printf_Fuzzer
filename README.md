# Printf_Fuzzer
This program exploits the printf C vulnerability.

## Why?
It is a simpler way to find certain addresses locally and also remotely and this means the only thing you are left to worry about is finding the correct offsets which can be done easily with gdb.

## Do this first
Change the script where it is specified, in order to be applicable for your binary.
